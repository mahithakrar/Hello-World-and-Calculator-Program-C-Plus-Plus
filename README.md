# Hello-World-and-Calculator-Program-C-Plus-Plus

Overview:
This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each program is designed to build a strong foundation in C++ by exploring key elements like input/output operations, data types, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

Hello World in C++ :
This is a basic C++ program that prints **"Hello World "** to the screen.
The "Hello World " program is usually the first step when learning a new programming language. It helps you understand how to:
- Write basic C++ syntax
- Use the `main` function
- Print text to the console using `cout`

Requirements :
A C++ Compiler

Conclusion:
UnderstOOD how to print text and get familiar with the syntax and structure of a simple C++ program.



# Calculator Program

This program acts as a basic command-line calculator that performs the four fundamental arithmetic operations:
1)Addition
2)Subtraction
3)Multiplication
4)Division

In C++, a calculator program demonstrates the use of:
- Input/output using `cin` and `cout`
- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Looping (if extended to multiple calculations)
- Functions (if modularized)


How it works:
1. The user is asked to enter two numbers.
2. The user then chooses an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).
3. The program performs the selected operation.
4. The result is printed on the screen.

Requirements:
1)A C++ compiler (like g++ or clang++)
2)Basic understanding of C++ syntax

Conclusion:
This calculator program is a simple way to understand how C++ handles:
 User input
 Arithmetic operations
It lays a strong foundation for more complex applications involving functions, loops, and error checking.
