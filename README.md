# 1.Hello World Program in C++

## Overview
This is a basic C++ program that prints the text **"Hello World"** to the console.  
It is often the first program beginners write when learning a new programming language, as it demonstrates the basic structure of the language and how to produce output.

---

## Theory
The "Hello World" program serves as an introductory example to understand:
- **Basic Syntax**: How a C++ program is structured.
- **Header Files**: `#include <iostream>` is used to include the input-output stream library.
- **Namespaces**: `using namespace std;` allows using standard library components without the `std::` prefix.
- **Output Statement**: `cout` is used to display output on the screen.
- **Main Function**: `int main()` is the entry point where execution begins.
- **Return Statement**: `return 0;` indicates the program executed successfully.

---

## Algorithm
1. **Start** the program.
2. Include the input-output stream library using `#include <iostream>`.
3. Use the standard namespace `using namespace std;`.
4. Define the `main()` function.
5. Inside the `main()` function, use `cout` to print **"Hello World"** to the console.
6. End the program by returning `0`.

# 2.Arithmetic Operations Program in C++

## Overview
This program takes two floating-point numbers as input from the user and performs the following arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division  

It then displays the results of these operations.

---

## Theory
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in programming and are used in almost every application that involves numerical data.  
In C++, these operations are performed using arithmetic operators:
- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division

**Key Components in the Program:**
1. **Header File**:  
   `#include <iostream>` is used for input and output operations.
2. **Namespace**:  
   `using namespace std;` allows using standard library names without the `std::` prefix.
3. **Data Types**:  
   `float` is used to store numbers with decimal values.
4. **Input/Output**:  
   - `cin` is used to take input from the user.
   - `cout` is used to display output.
5. **Variables**:  
   - `num1` and `num2` store the user inputs.
   - `sum`, `subtraction`, `product`, and `division` store results of operations.

---

## Algorithm
1. **Start** the program.
2. Include the input-output stream library using `#include <iostream>`.
3. Use the standard namespace `using namespace std;`.
4. Declare `float` variables: `num1`, `num2`, `sum`, `product`, `subtraction`, and `division`.
5. Prompt the user to **enter the first number** and store it in `num1`.
6. Prompt the user to **enter the second number** and store it in `num2`.
7. Perform addition: `sum = num1 + num2` and display the result.
8. Perform subtraction: `subtraction = num1 - num2` and display the result.
9. Perform multiplication: `product = num1 * num2` and display the result.
10. Perform division: `division = num1 / num2` and display the result.
11. **End** the program.


**Conclusion:**  
By completing both programs, learners gain an understanding of:
- The syntax and structure of a C++ program.
- How to work with input and output streams.
- How to use variables to store data.
- Performing basic operations and displaying results.
- The importance of sequential logic in problem-solving.
